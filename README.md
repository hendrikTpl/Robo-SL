# Robo-SL Systems

This project aims to develop a Robot-Assisted Deaf/Speech-Impaired People via Sign Languages.
There are three parts we want to achieve as follows:
* 1 Perception
* 2 Motion Control
* 3 Localization and Mapping 

# Perception
### Skeleton-Based Graph Convolution Network

# Motion Control / Mechanical Design of Robo-SL
### TEO Humanoid Robot


# Localization and Mapping
### SLAM Method
